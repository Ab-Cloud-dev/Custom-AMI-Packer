# Lab 03: Packer Post-Processors - Artifact Management and Tracking

This lab demonstrates how to use Packer post-processors to manage and track artifacts created during the build process. Post-processors run after the image is built and provisioned, providing capabilities for artifact management, documentation, and distribution.

## Prerequisites

- Completed Lab 01 (Basic Packer Template)
- Completed Lab 02 (Provisioners)
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Understanding of JSON format

## Duration
‚è±Ô∏è **30 minutes**

---

## Lab Overview

This lab consists of three main tasks:

- **Task 1**: Add manifest post-processor for artifact tracking
- **Task 2**: Validate the enhanced Packer template
- **Task 3**: Build AMI and analyze the generated manifest

---

## What are Post-Processors?

Post-processors are components that run **after** the builder creates the image and **after** all provisioners have finished configuring it. They operate on the artifacts produced by builders and can perform various operations such as:

### Common Post-Processor Types:

üîß **Manifest**: Creates a JSON file listing all artifacts produced
üì¶ **Compress**: Creates compressed archives of artifacts
üöÄ **Shell-Local**: Runs commands on the local machine after build
üì§ **Artifice**: Re-packages existing artifacts
üåê **Docker**: Manages Docker container artifacts
‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Upload**: Uploads artifacts to cloud storage

### Post-Processor Workflow:

```
Builder ‚Üí Provisioner(s) ‚Üí Post-Processor(s) ‚Üí Final Artifacts
```

---

## Why Use the Manifest Post-Processor?

The manifest post-processor is particularly valuable for:

‚úÖ **Multi-Build Tracking**: Keep track of artifacts across multiple builds  
‚úÖ **Automation Integration**: Parse artifact IDs for downstream automation  
‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: Maintain records of what was built and when  
‚úÖ **CI/CD Integration**: Feed artifact information to deployment pipelines  
‚úÖ **Documentation**: Generate reports of build outputs

---

## Task 1: Add Manifest Post-Processor

### Step 1.1: Understanding the Manifest Post-Processor

The manifest post-processor writes a JSON file containing:
- **Build Details**: Builder type, build time, and configuration
- **Artifact IDs**: AMI IDs, container names, or file paths
- **Metadata**: Build UUIDs, custom data, and timestamps

### Step 1.2: Update Your Template

Add the manifest post-processor to your `aws-ubuntu01.pkr.hcl` file:

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    amazon = {
      version = ">= 1.2.8" // Require Amazon plugin version 1.2.8 or higher
      source  = "github.com/hashicorp/amazon" // Plugin source location
    }
  }
}

source "amazon-ebs" "ubuntu" {
  ami_name      = "packer-ubuntu-aws-{{timestamp}}" // Name of the new AMI, with a timestamp for uniqueness
  instance_type = "t3.micro"                        // EC2 instance type used for building the AMI
  region        = "us-east-1"                       // Primary AWS region for building the AMI

  source_ami_filter {
    filters = {
      name                = "ubuntu/images/*ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-*" // Filter for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS images
      root-device-type    = "ebs"                                              // Only EBS-backed images
      virtualization-type = "hvm"                                              // Only HVM virtualization
    }
    most_recent = true                 // Use the most recent image that matches the filter
    owners      = ["099720109477"]     // Canonical's AWS account ID (official Ubuntu images)
  }

  ssh_username = "ubuntu" // Default SSH username for Ubuntu AMIs

  tags = {
    "Name"        = "Multi-region-Ubuntu-AMI" // Tag for the AMI name
    "Environment" = "Production"              // Tag for environment
    "OS_Version"  = "Ubuntu 22.04"            // Tag for OS version
    "Release"     = "Latest"                  // Tag for release
    "Created-by"  = "Packer"                  // Tag to indicate AMI was created by Packer
  }
}

build {
  sources = [
    "source.amazon-ebs.ubuntu" // Reference to the source block above
  ]

  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = [
      "echo Installing Updates",           // Print message to the console
      "sudo apt-get update",               // Update package lists
      "sudo apt-get upgrade -y",           // Upgrade installed packages
      "sudo apt-get install -y nginx"      // Install nginx web server
    ]
    // No errors here, but if you want to run additional scripts, add more commands or provisioners.
  }

  post-processor "manifest" {} // Generates a manifest file after build
}

// No syntax errors found. 
// If you want to copy files or run additional scripts, add file or shell provisioners.

```

### Key Configuration Options:

- **`output`**: Specifies the manifest file name (default: `packer-manifest.json`)
- **`strip_path`**: Removes path information from file artifacts for cleaner output

---

## Task 2: Validate the Enhanced Template

### Step 2.1: Format and Validate

Always ensure your template is properly formatted and valid:

```bash
packer fmt packer-image.pkr.hcl  
packer validate packer-image.pkr.hcl  
```

‚úÖ **Expected Output**: `The configuration is valid.`

### Step 2.2: Verify Template Structure

Your template now includes:
- **Source Block**: Defines the base AMI and build configuration
- **Build Block**: Contains provisioners and post-processors
- **Provisioner**: Installs system updates and Nginx
- **Post-Processor**: Creates artifact manifest

---

## Task 3: Build AMI and Analyze Manifest

### Step 3.1: Execute the Build

Run the build command to create your AMI with manifest tracking:

```bash
packer build packer-image.pkr.hcl  
```

### Step 3.2: Verify Manifest Creation

After the build completes, check for the manifest file:

<img width="598" height="281" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/592d4e56-3d19-4323-9227-c9f28c41d920" />


‚úÖ **Success Indicator**: The `packer-manifest.json` file should be present

### Step 3.3: Analyze the Manifest

View the contents of the generated manifest:

```bash
cat packer-manifest.json
```

**Sample Manifest Output:**
```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "name": "ubuntu",
      "builder_type": "amazon-ebs",
      "build_time": 1755192522,
      "files": null,
      "artifact_id": "us-east-1:ami-0e2c1a9d5e7841d79",
      "packer_run_uuid": "fd1b29a2-296d-66cf-7489-af3e90190be7",
      "custom_data": null
    }
  ],
  "last_run_uuid": "fd1b29a2-296d-66cf-7489-af3e90190be7"
}
```

### Step 3.4: Understanding Manifest Fields

| Field | Description | Example Value |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **`name`** | Build name from source block | `"ubuntu"` |
| **`builder_type`** | Type of builder used | `"amazon-ebs"` |
| **`build_time`** | Unix timestamp of build completion | `1755192522` |
| **`files`** | Local files created (null for AMIs) | `null` |
| **`artifact_id`** | Comma-separated list of created AMI IDs | `"us-east-1:ami-0e2c1a9d5e7841d79"` |
| **`packer_run_uuid`** | Unique identifier for this build run | `"fd1b29a2-296d-66cf-7489-af3e90190be7"` |
| **`custom_data`** | User-defined metadata | `null` |

## Advanced Post-Processor Configurations

### Multiple Post-Processors

You can chain multiple post-processors:

```hcl
build {
  sources = ["source.amazon-ebs.ubuntu"]

  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = ["echo 'Build completed'"]
  }

  # Generate manifest
  post-processor "manifest" {
    output = "build-manifest.json"
  }

  # Run local commands after build
  post-processor "shell-local" {
    inline = [
      "echo 'Build completed at: $(date)'",
      "echo 'AMI IDs created:' && jq -r '.builds[].artifact_id' build-manifest.json"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Custom Manifest Output

Customize the manifest file location and name:

```hcl
post-processor "manifest" {
  output     = "artifacts/build-${timestamp()}.json"
  strip_path = true
  custom_data = {
    build_version = "1.0.0"
    environment   = "production"
  }
}
```

---

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**

Extract AMI IDs for deployment automation:

```bash
# Extract AMI ID for specific region
AMI_ID=$(jq -r '.builds[0].artifact_id' packer-manifest.json | grep 'us-west-2' | cut -d':' -f2)
echo "Deploying AMI: $AMI_ID"
```

### 2. **Infrastructure as Code**

Update Terraform variables with new AMI IDs:

```bash
# Update Terraform variables file
echo "ami_id = \"$(jq -r '.builds[0].artifact_id' packer-manifest.json | cut -d',' -f1 | cut -d':' -f2)\"" > terraform.tfvars
```

### 3. **Build Verification**

Verify successful multi-region deployment (If the AMI is deployed in multi-region):

```bash
# Count created AMIs
AMI_COUNT=$(jq -r '.builds[0].artifact_id' packer-manifest.json | tr ',' '\n' | wc -l)
echo "Created $AMI_COUNT AMIs across regions"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Manifest File Not Created**
- Verify post-processor syntax in template
- Check for build failures before post-processor execution
- Ensure proper permissions in output directory

**Empty or Invalid JSON**
- Validate template with `packer validate`
- Check for syntax errors in post-processor block
- Verify build completed successfully

**Missing AMI IDs**
- Confirm AMIs were actually created in AWS console
- Check AWS permissions for AMI creation
- Verify multi-region copying completed

---

## Best Practices

### üìù **Documentation**
- Include manifest files in version control for audit trails
- Use descriptive output filenames with timestamps
- Document the purpose of each post-processor

### üîí **Security**
- Don't include sensitive data in custom_data fields
- Use IAM roles instead of embedding credentials
- Regularly clean up old manifest files

### üöÄ **Automation**
- Parse manifest files in deployment scripts
- Validate artifact creation before proceeding
- Use manifest data for rollback procedures
